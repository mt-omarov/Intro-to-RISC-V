# RISC-V International
## What is RISC-V International?
The [RISC-V Foundation](The RISC-V Foundation was founded in 2015 to build an open, collaborative community of software and hardware innovators based on the RISC-V ISA. The Foundation, a non-profit corporation controlled by its members, directed the development to drive the initial adoption of the RISC-V ISA.

Across 2018-2019, the RISC-V community reflected on the geo-political landscape and heard concerns from around the world that investment in RISC-V must come with IP access continuity to ensure a long-term strategic investment. We first mentioned our intentions to move at the December 2018 summit. Incorporation in Switzerland has the effect of calming concerns of political disruption to the open collaboration model. As a non-profit, membership-based organization, RISC-V International does not maintain any commercial interest in products or services. There have not been any export restrictions on RISC-V in the US and we have complied with all US laws. The move does not circumvent any existing restrictions, but rather alleviates uncertainty going forward.

In March 2020, the RISC-V International Association was incorporated in Switzerland. Along with this, we shifted to a new, more inclusive membership structure. Members of RISC-V International have access to and participate in the development of the RISC-V ISA specification and extensions as well as related hardware and software. RISC-V has a Board of Directors composed of member representatives as well as a Technical Committee of work group leaders.

RISC-V International’s decision to incorporate in Switzerland is not based on any one country, company, government, or event. This move is reflective of community concern and managing strategic risk for our community investing in RISC-V for the next 50+ years.

The IP contributed and produced by RISC-V International is held under industry and global standard licenses that are already open to leverage by any company regardless of jurisdiction. This licensing is a common open source approach to foster collaboration that is not tied to any geographic regulation. Open Source IP has not been subject to export control.

We encourage organizations, individuals, and enthusiasts to join our ecosystem and together enable a new era of processor innovation through open standard and open source collaboration.) was founded in 2015 to build an open, collaborative community of software and hardware innovators based on the RISC-V ISA.

## RISC-V International Membership
RISC-V is a non-profit membership-based organization that is driven by its members through representative governance on a Board of Directors, a Technical Steering Committee, and many other working committees.

Membership is offered at various levels, and members receive a wealth of benefits. Most importantly, the membership process provides intellectual property protection for all members as well as provenance and IP security for the RISC-V ISA itself, which is RISC-V International’s top priority. All members are able to participate fully in the technical development process as well as in project administration through various working groups and committees. Members are also able to participate in a number of annual events and workshops and to stay on the leading edge of RISC-V development. All benefits are outlined on the [membership page](https://riscv.org/membership/).

One common question is why RISC-V insists on membership rather than opening contribution and participation to the general public in the manner of the Linux kernel and many other open source software projects. The primary reason for this is the IP protection just mentioned. The RISC-V membership agreement and the Articles of Association provide solid protection, but their scope is limited to members who actually sign the agreement.

While active participation is limited to members for this reason, RISC-V does make the entire technical process transparent (in read-only fashion) to non-members, and provides a wealth of learning opportunities as well as a set of public discussion lists where experienced RISC-V developers often contribute.

Membership in RISC-V is free for individual people, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations. For-profit companies have three membership levels available with annual dues, which support the ongoing collective support, facilitation, and advocacy of RISC-V as well as the following programs to foster the technical development, academic inclusion, market adoption, and industry visibility of our RISC-V community and members.

Members become **Premier Members** in order to have a seat at the table for the governance of RISC-V itself. Premier TSC members get a seat on the Technical Steering Committee, which governs the technical process, while full Premier level members earn a seat on the Board of Directors as well as the TSC.

**Strategic Members** make up the largest proportion of RISC-V membership, and include companies from dozens of industries as well as a number of academic institutions who want to support RISC-V financially. Strategic members pay dues according to their organizational size, with four tiers available. Strategic members elect three representatives to the Board of Directors annually.

**Community Organizations** include academic and non-profit organizations, many of whom also participate in the Academia & Training Special Interest Group to exchange ideas and educational materials. Community Organizations pay no dues, although many of them choose to sponsor RISC-V events. Community Organizations elect one representative annually to the Board of Directors for their group.

All Organizational members - Premier, Strategic, and Community Organization - have access to the RISC-V Trademark, which includes the RISC-V name and logo.

**Community Individuals** are some of the most active members of the RISC-V community. There are active Individuals in all technical and non-technical working groups and special interest groups. Community Individuals pay no dues, and they elect one representative annually to the Board of Directors for their group. Individuals do not have access to the RISC-V trademark, but many of them are able to convince their employers or other organizations they are affiliated with to join RISC-V as an organization.

## RISC-V International Governance
RISC-V International is governed by its Board of Directors. The Board is composed of Directors elected to represent all classes of membership to ensure we offer a strategic voice at all levels. In addition, the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) provides leadership to our technical initiatives in setting long term strategy, forming tactical committees and work groups, and approving technical deliverables for ratification or release.

RISC-V International also supports and drives technical working groups - committees, task groups, and special interest groups - to pursue specific industry, geographic, and strategic interest through a variety of constructs. Working groups are chaired by community members who drive developers toward consensus. Our aim is to guide and facilitate the broadest and most effective collaboration for the benefit of our member community.

## RISC-V Community Working Model
Community development is core to RISC-V International - there is no single company behind the scenes, and without the active community of architects and developers, there would be no RISC-V.

You will learn more about the practicalities of community-based specification development in Chapter 3 of this series. What we’d like to describe here is what the community looks like and how each part of the community contributes to making RISC-V the holistic, heterogeneous, vibrant community that it is.

Specification development teams - whom we call the “tech” community - are composed of RISC-V International members, including both individuals and organizations. Although each member participates at their own level, we welcome everyone’s voice in the development process. Working groups and committees are chaired by member organizations, but it is possible for a sufficiently enthusiastic and skilled individual member to help lead a working group if they earn support from the community and the TSC.

All members are welcome to participate and contribute in technical groups through mailing lists, meetings and workshops, webinars and conferences, and in many other ways. The technical working groups are publicly visible so that non-members can also follow discussions and progress.

In addition, there are three public forums where anyone may participate:
- The RISC-V public mailing lists, particularly [ISA-Dev](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/groups.riscv.org/g/isa-dev?pli=1) and [SW-Dev](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/groups.riscv.org/g/sw-dev), which date back to the earliest days of RISC-V
- The [Exchange forums](https://exchange.riscv.org/) which provide a focused discussion point for items that appear on the RISC-V Exchange
- The [RISC-V Slack channel](https://risc-v-international.slack.com/) for live chat

## RISC-V’s Relationship with the Linux Foundation
In November 2018, the RISC-V Foundation announced a joint collaboration with the Linux Foundation. As part of this collaboration, the Linux Foundation provides operational, technical, and strategic support for RISC-V International, including member management, accounting, training programs, infrastructure tools, community outreach, marketing, legal, and other open source services and expertise.
