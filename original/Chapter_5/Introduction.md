# Introduction
In this chapter, we will get some hands-on experience programming RISC-V assembly language for the Linux operating system. Even if you’ve never programmed assembly before, this chapter will give you all the information you need to get started writing your first “Hello World” application. Feel free to follow along, or simply read through the material and watch the videos.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Understand how to emulate a simple Linux system using QEMU.
- Write a simple “Hello World” program in RISC-V 64 bit assembly language.
- Compile and run a RISC-V application in emulation.
