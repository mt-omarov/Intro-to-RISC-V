# Administrative & Executive Groups
## Additional Roles
Even highly technical organizations like RISC-V canâ€™t operate in a vacuum. RISC-V has an active Board of Directors, a vibrant Marketing/Visibility organization, and a trained operations staff, along with management services provided by the Linux Foundation. These are just some of the groups within the administration that keep RISC-V on track.

**Board of Directors**
The Board is the primary decision-making body for RISC-V. As such, it has representation from all members. Premier members each have a seat at the table, while Strategic, Community Organization, and even Community Individual level members elect representatives each year.

**Marketing & Visibility**
RISC-V has a Director of Marketing who is responsible for driving the visibility of RISC-V worldwide. Working with the Marketing Committee, a member group that provides feedback and resources, the Director of Marketing manages all visibility activities, including the main Marketing Committee, Events, Content (including written, video, and in-person content), social media and PR (supported by an outside firm), and developer advocacy activities including online learning, RISC-V Ambassadors, Regional and Industry Alliances, and the quickly-growing RISC-V user community.

**Operations & Program Management**
Operations include the day-to-day management of member activities - joining RISC-V, onboarding, paying dues, becoming part of the Member Portal, and other member activities - as well as support for all other business functions within RISC-V International.
