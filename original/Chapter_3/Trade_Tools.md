## Communication Channels
Communication is the most critical part of community-based development, whether in open source software, open specifications, open standards or any other type of shared resource development. RISC-V uses best practices drawn from decades of experience in open source and academia.

While we wonâ€™t go through every communication point here, as they can sometimes change and evolve, we will go over the most important types of communication points and how to access them.

## Member Portal
The RISC-V mailing lists consist of moderated, members-only discussions related to the development of the RISC-V ISA, other specifications, testing frameworks, and software. Mailing lists are a valuable tool for asynchronous communication, as they preserve the entire conversation with date stamps in a searchable form.

Most technical groups (committees, task groups, and SIGs) within RISC-V operate with [public visibility](https://lists.riscv.org/g/main) - active participation is limited to members, but anyone can read the archives. Administrative and executive groups within RISC-V are visible to RISC-V members only.

## Meetings
Mailing lists are great, but often the efficiency of communication can be greatly enhanced with meetings. Most RISC-V working groups meet on a regular basis using Zoom, with minutes recorded so nothing is lost.

## Slack
In addition to mailing lists, many RISC-V developers use synchronous online communications, particularly during events. RISC-V provides a Slack space with many channels on various topics. Activity on these channels is not preserved, but the channels are a great way to have a live discussion without the overhead of a meeting or phone call.

## GitHub
Most work on deliverables is done using GitHub, which provides a working model that is well suited to technical development. GitHub provides version control, continuous integration and building for both software and documentation, issue tracking, and a well-documented approval chain.

## Shared Storage and RISC-V Wiki
Like most open source projects RISC-V has a [wiki](https://wiki.riscv.org/) that contains a wealth of information. All of the information in our wiki is open to the public, however some of the links may lead to areas available only to RISC-V members.

## Technical Policies
The technical organization operates on a group of policies which are often updated to include best practices. These policies form the basis for the development processes within RISC-V and enable more than 2,000 developers to work together.

## Public Discussion Groups
There is also a set of public discussion lists that does not require membership. You can join these discussions and others using links from the [technical page](https://riscv.org/technical/technical-forums/) on the website.

## Public Conferences, Workshops, and Local Events
RISC-V International hosts a number of events each year, culminating in our annual RISC-V Summit in December. In addition, RISC-V sponsors and participates in many industry events, and RISC-V Affiliates also host events around the world. In particular, the local events serve as a great opportunity to learn about RISC-V and to meet people in specific areas. Events are tracked on the [RISC-V website](https://riscv.org/events/) and discussed often on the Marketing Events Committee calls.

## The RISC-V Exchange
The RISC-V Exchange provides a window into work that people have accomplished around the world in the RISC-V community, including physical hardware, IP cores, and a great deal of software. This section of our website will grow as hardware and software continue to be created.

The Exchange contains:
- Available Boards \
RISC-V based single board computers (SBCs) both open source hardware and proprietary designs. These range from simple microcontroller boards to complex System on Chip (SoC) designs.
- Available Cores & SoCs \
These hardware designs might be open source or proprietary, and may be available for free or for purchase.
- Available Software \
Software is available in binary form and in source code form. Licenses stretch across the spectrum from permissive open source to restrictive proprietary licenses.
- Available Services \
Many organizations provide services relevant to RISC-V product development, including design, verification, software tooling, and more.
- Available Learning \
Books, online courses, curricula and academic materials, and anything else related to learning about RISC-V.
